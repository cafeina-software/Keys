# Keys 0.0.1

This is an unstable initial version intended only for testing and previewing.
It works if it is used to view and list data, but editing features are not
completely stable, although behind the scenes the changes are always saved, that
is not always replicated to the user interface. It also could contain
a number of stability issues that could make it not useful for end users.

* New features:

- New application written from scratch, using the Haiku Key Storage API.
- It can display the keyrings in the keystore, as well as keys in each keyrings,
  and which applications were allowed to access each keyring. For each key,
  it is possible to display the key metadata and its value.
- UNSTABLE (ui level): it can create and delete keyrings.
- UNSTABLE (ui level): it can create and delete keys under a keyring.
- It can revoke (remove) an application authorization to a certain keyring.
- It can restart the keystore_server if for some reason it was ended.

* Miscellaneous:

- Naming: the name "Keys" does what its name says, it is intended to
  deal with things that have to do with the keystore of Haiku.
